# Redot Modules

Someone mentioned a lack of encryption modules
so here you go. This will be pushed into Redot
whenever I'm done/get a chance.

## Dependencies

OpenSSL3.0+

## Details

I have only tested this on OpenBSD and Linux.

## Progress

* RSA - This works. 
* Blowfish - This does not work.

## I want to help

Go for it. Break it. Add to it. 

## What license is this

MIT?
